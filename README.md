# TD Skills for Claude Code

Treasure Data skills for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) to enhance productivity with TD-specific tools and workflows.

## What Are Skills?

Skills are folders of instructions and resources that Claude loads dynamically to improve performance on specialized tasks. These TD skills teach Claude how to use our tools and follow our best practices.

## SQL Analyst Suite - Auto-Invocation

**Five core SQL skills automatically activate based on your questions:**

| Skill | Activates When | Examples |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| **analytical-query** | Asking for analysis/metrics/trends | "Top 10 products by revenue", "Count daily signups", "Show revenue trends" |
| **smart-sampler** | Asking for data samples/records | "Show 100 sample orders", "Give me examples of null emails", "Preview recent data" |
| **schema-explorer** | Asking about schema/structure/PII | "What tables are available?", "Show me the schema for orders", "Find PII columns" |
| **data-profiler** | Asking for data quality/distributions | "Profile the orders table", "Analyze data quality", "What's the distribution of revenue?" |
| **query-explainer** | Sharing SQL queries to understand | "Explain this query: [SQL]", "What does this do?", "Break down this query" |

## Creating Your Own TD Skills

To add a new TD-specific skill:

1. Create a new directory under the appropriate category:
   ```bash
   mkdir sql-skills/your-skill-name

   mkdir workflow-skills/your-skill-name
   # or
   mkdir field-agent-skills/your-skill-name
   ```

2. Create a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (see [template-skill](./template-skill/SKILL.md))

3. Update `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` to register the new skill:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "sql-skills",
     "skills": [
       "./sql-skills/trino",
       "./sql-skills/hive",
       "./sql-skills/your-skill-name"  // Add your skill path here (must start with ./)
